season_stats.py
===============
Persistent, season-long stat logging for tracked Rainbow Six Siege players.

Pipeline (see SEASON_STATS.md for the full integration guide):

    .rec / match folder
        -> parser.parse_match()                 (r6-dissect JSON -> MatchData)
        -> metrics_engine.compute_match_metrics  (MatchData -> per-player, per-round results)
        -> StatsManager.log_match()              (results -> SQLite season totals)

Storage is a single SQLite file:

    tracked_players  who to record (only these players' stats are ever saved)
    player_totals    running season totals per (season, username)
    logged_rounds    one row per (season, match_id, round_num, username) --
                     its PRIMARY KEY is what makes logging idempotent: a round
                     that was already counted for a player is skipped, so
                     re-importing a replay (or the same match as a folder after
                     importing single rounds) never double-counts.
    player_season_stats  VIEW adding the derived stats (KD, KOST%, entry diff)

Every log_match() call runs in one transaction: a match is either fully
counted or not counted at all.
