ask_engine.py
=============
Answers plain-English questions about the stats database (stats_db.py). Nobody
writes a query: the question is read into a Query -- what to measure, for whom,
grouped how, filtered how -- which becomes SQL, and the answer comes back as a
sentence, a table and, for trends, a chart. It all runs on this PC: no AI service,
nothing sent anywhere.

    answer = ask("How has my K/D changed over my last 10 matches?", db)
    answer.headline  # "Your K/D went from 0.71 to 0.92: improving."

What it understands:
    whose stats   you ("my", "I"), a player by name (or the part before the clan tag:
                  "Paltry"), a team built on the Team page, "we"/"our" (your side in
                  your matches), "teammates", "opponents", "everyone"
    what          K/D, kills, deaths, assists, KPR, headshot %, KOST, survival, entry,
                  clutches, multikills, trades, plants, defuses, EPS, win rate, wins,
                  losses, matches, rounds -- and everyday words for them
    grouped by    player ("who", "which teammate"), map, operator, side, site, match
                  type, match ("over time", "trend", "improving"), day, week, month
    filtered by   a map, an operator, attack/defense, ranked/unranked, wins/losses,
                  "last 10 matches", "last week", "since Sep 20", "in September",
                  "more than 10 kills" (matches where that happened), "at least 5 matches"
    and gives     a value, a ranking, a trend, a comparison ("X vs Y"), a count
                  ("how many"), a record, a summary ("how is X doing") or a match list

Only words the engine knows become SQL (metrics, groupings, orderings); every name,
number and date from a question is passed as a parameter.
